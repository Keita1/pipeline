Complete Pipeline Training at Big Data Scala By the Bay

We want to create a uniform data pipeline, e.g. tweets, flowing through Akka=>Kafka=>Spark=>Cassandra.  E.g. Helena Edelson has a KilrWeather app that can be reused.

We want to make sure that each system can be setup and the pipeline run from the same repo.  We'll converge on the exact app together.

The training will be a single day, with 5 companies teaching an hour-90 min segment each in sequence, in the above order.  Mesosphere will be underpinning it with Mesos and go first.
